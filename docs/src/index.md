# RabiRamseySpectroscopy.jl

(This section is WIP)
RabiRamseySpectroscopy.jl provides core toolset for simulating Rabi/Ramsey spectroscopy experiments.
The main goal is to have ready-to-use, simple-to-understand modeling toolkit with experimenters in mind.
Furthermore, it can be used as introduction to spectroscopy for people with little physics background or
students.

## Installation

To install RabiRamseySpectroscopy.jl, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("RabiRamseySpectroscopy")
```

## Development

(This section is WIP)
If you want to help develop this package, you can do it via GitHub default instruments(pull requests,
issues etc.) and/or contact me: sciencefloppa@gmail.com. In additon, it is highly recommended to read or
modify code of RabiRamseySpectroscopy.jl with JuliaMono font installed. That way UTF-8 symbols will be
displayed correctly.
